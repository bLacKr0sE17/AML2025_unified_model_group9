# Exploratory Models

This folder contains intermediate and exploratory model variants that were
tested during development but not selected as the final submission.

These include:
- alternative weighting strategies
- different random seeds
- dataset-only baselines
- class-balanced variants
- ablation experiments

They are kept for transparency and reproducibility.
The final selected model is documented in `/final_model/`.
