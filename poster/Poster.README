## Project Poster 


The poster reflects our journey to exploring the datasets, different models and developing the baseline. To reflect this most often iterative process, the following sections of the project were developed:
# 1) Dataset understanding & preprocessing
Initial inspection of HELOC, HIGGS, and Covertype, cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing consistent inputs.

# 2) Exploratory analysis & feature considerations
Basic EDA (distributions, class imbalance), feature alignment across datasets, and preliminary feature relevance checks (e.g., Mutual Information / PCA), fitting different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM)

# 3) Baseline development (TabSTAR)
Developing a pre-trained model from HuggingFace and fitting all available data without balancing the model and predicting the accuracy on the test set

#4) Unified model design & evaluation (LightGBM)
Building a single multiclass LightBGM model over the unified train data, addressing imbalance by weighting and comparing results against the baseline.
