Experiments include:
- early unified baselines
- dataset-only and dataset_id ablations
- comparison between 9-class and 11-class unified label encodings
- class-balanced and dataset-weighted LightGBM variants
- NaN vs zero-based feature alignment strategies
- comparison with XGBoost and other tree-based baselines
- different random seeds and diagnostic submissions
- partial retraining and intermediate Kaggle submissions

These experiments informed the design of the final unified LightGBM model, but are not part of the final submission.
