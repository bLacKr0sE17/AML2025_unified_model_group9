## Exploratory Models

This directory contains exploratory notebooks and intermediate Kaggle submissions
used during model development.

Experiments include:
- early unified baselines
- dataset-only and dataset-ID ablations
- class-balanced and weighted LightGBM variants
- different random seeds and loss functions
- partial retraining and diagnostic submissions

These experiments informed the design of the final unified LightGBM model,
but are not part of the final submission.
